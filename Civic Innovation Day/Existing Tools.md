  * [Maryland DOE Integrated Report Water Quality Assesment Maps](http://www.mde.state.md.us/programs/Water/TMDL/Integrated303dReports/Pages/ImpairmentMaps.aspx_) can be a interesting way to gathering data, but more importantly, visualizing data.

# Ensuring Informed Input #

Thougts about how to help people understand the issues before submitting data/reports.

Also helps tackle the issue of "bettering" input and filtering input to most relevant data -- educated users give more useful data. 

* Infographics
* Mandatory education
* [Example](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/povich/milky-way-project/classify) of a project with good best practices

# Notes #

 * Citizen-involved projects almost always do better / last longer when the users are given tangible results from their contributions
   * Incentive system - maybe partnerships with local businesses, e.g. "report X number of positively identified spills and get  $15 gift card to ___"
      * possible reward for consistently accurate reports -- if a user's reports are verifiably high-quality and/or lead to more positive hits by inspectors, rewarding those users can encourage high-quality reports. 
 * Citizen Science Platforms can be a useful tool for learning how to best entice a community to participate, how to engage them, and how to shap the experience
